  "Invariants checked against the final read, which happens after every fault
  has been healed and the network has had time to converge:

  - every channel opened during setup is still ChannelReady;
  - no channel still holds pending TLCs;
  - both ends of a channel agree on its balances (A's local = B's remote);
  - each channel's total (local + remote) equals its total at the start of the
    test: payments move money within a channel, they never create or destroy it;
  - every payment reached Success or Failed;
  - no payment the client saw succeed later reports a different status;
  - a fresh payment each way over every channel (the probe) succeeds: the
    network can still move money once faults are gone. A direction is excused
    only if the final read shows its sender's balance on that channel below the
    probe amount."
